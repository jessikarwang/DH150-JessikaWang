# Assignment 04 - Jessika Wang

## Project Design Challenge
How can I provide community with other plant "moms" and gardeners for middle aged women seeking to share their love for plants and learn more about the topic? 


My project hopes to support middle-aged women with a community that understands their hobbies and helps them grow as people, especially during a time of isolation. For many people, gardening is a form of therapy and gives them a sense of serenity when spending time with their plants. We can understand these motivations better in order to further advance the therapeutic aspects of gardening, while providing a bond over the love of plants. The project also hopes to enable gardeners to share their proudest plant growths and help one another become better gardeners. 


Though there are resources about gardening found online and opportunities to join planting communities, I want to be able to mesh the two well, after understanding the user and their motivations behind their love for gardening. 

## Target Users
The main target of user is middle-aged women, though it can be anyone who loves gardening and takes pride in their plants. This user has an extreme joy and enthusiasm when talking about and caring for plants, either indoor or outdoor plants. Ideally, the user has a large collection of plants they are raising and spends a significant amount of time tending to its needs. To the user, tending to plants are a form of therapy or a stress-reliever. The user enjoys learning more about plants and sharing their expertise and advice to others about their own garderning journey. Overall, they crave the ability to share their love of plants with others!


The user must be able to access internet connection to use this product. They would do this activity in their own homes, where they can take pictures and look at their own plants while using the product. 

## Research Methods
In order to better understand users and their motivations, I conducted a contextual inquiry on my roommate who enjoys gardening and learning about plants. The methods I used were interview and participatory observation. This was conducted in the apartment in a quiet environment. 


The session included the following sections:


**1. Background Questions**


**2. Observations**


**3. Follow-up Questions**
