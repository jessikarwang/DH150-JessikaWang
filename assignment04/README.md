# Assignment 04 - Jessika Wang

## Project Design Challenge
How can I provide community with other plant "moms" and gardeners for middle-aged women seeking to share their love for plants and learn more about the topic? 


My project hopes to support middle-aged women with a community that understands their hobbies and helps them grow as people, especially during a time of isolation. For many people, gardening is a form of therapy and gives them a sense of serenity when spending time with their plants. We can understand these motivations better in order to further advance the therapeutic aspects of gardening, while providing a bond over the love of plants. The project also hopes to enable gardeners to share their proudest plant growths and help one another become better gardeners. 


Though there are resources about gardening found online and opportunities to join planting communities, I want to be able to mesh the two well, after understanding the user and their motivations behind their love for gardening. 

## Target Users
The main target of user is middle-aged women, though it can be anyone who loves gardening and takes pride in their plants. This user has an extreme joy and enthusiasm when talking about and caring for plants, either indoor or outdoor plants. Ideally, the user has a large collection of plants they are raising and spends a significant amount of time tending to its needs. To the user, tending to plants are a form of therapy or a stress-reliever. The user enjoys learning more about plants and sharing their expertise and advice to others about their own garderning journey. Overall, they crave the ability to share their love of plants with others!


The user must be able to access internet connection to use this product. They would do this activity in their own homes, where they can take pictures and look at their own plants while using the product. 

## Research Methods
In order to better understand users and their motivations, I conducted a contextual inquiry on my roommate who enjoys gardening and learning about plants. The methods I used were interview and participatory observation. This was conducted in the apartment in a quiet environment. 


The session included the following sections:


**1. Background Questions** I wanted to learn about the user's decision-making reasoning around their major and hobbies. I also wanted to learn more about their initial ideas around hobby-centered communities. I also want to know the user's typical day to support their lifestyle and needs.


**2. Observations** First, I asked the user to search up any topic on their preferred website and walk me through their thought process. I asked questions throughout the task to learn more about their reasoning. I also asked whether they felt a community online forum was reliable. Next, I asked the user to search for gardening related topics and asked more in depth about their experiences of an online gardening community. I also asked what they are looking for when searching topics and their thoughts on sharing their own gardening experiences online.


**3. Follow-up Questions** I asked direct follow-up questions to find other sources of an online gardening reasource and community. I also asked about their ideas for an online garden community.

## Reflection
I found this interview very interesting, since the tasks were much broader than the usability testing. When creating the interview, I wanted to create questions and tasks that would not create bias and truly allow the participant to lead the activity. Because of this, I was not able to stick to the script as strictly as I did in the usability testing and had to think on my feet to move the activity along. However, I think both the participant and I created an interview that can lead to useful information to understand the user better. For instance, when thinking about finding resources and gardening community, I did not even consider video platforms. However, my participant was adamant that Youtube is the main platform she uses to learn new information. She also brought up her concerns about the importance of respectful online communities, which I did not consider before either. 


In the future, I would create tasks that are a little more guided since when I told the particpant to search up any information, she searched up a garden related topic, which was my step 2. This caused me to change my script slightly on the spot and ask her to do other types of task I did not prepare for. I believe she searched up a gardening topic because that was the last hobby she listed, so maybe I should have asked her to search up something else other than gardening. Other than this, I believe the interview went smoothly and I was able to understand the user's perspective better and learn about aspects they would seek in a gardening resource and online community.
