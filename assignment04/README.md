# Assignment 04 - Jessika Wang

## Project Design Challenge
How can I provide community with other plant "moms" and gardeners for middle aged women seeking to share their love for plants and learn more about the topic? 


My project hopes to support middle-aged women with a community that understands their hobbies and helps them grow as people, especially during a time of isolation. For many people, gardening is a form of therapy and gives them a sense of serenity when spending time with their plants. We can understand these motivations better in order to further advance the therapeutic aspects of gardening, while providing a bond over the love of plants.


Though there are resources about gardening found online and opportunities to join planting communities, I want to be able to mesh the two well, after understanding the user and their motivations behind their love for gardening.
