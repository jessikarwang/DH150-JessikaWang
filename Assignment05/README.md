# Assignment 05 - Persona + Scenario
## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows developers and designers to truly understand specific target users and their motivations in order to create a product that caters to their needs and desires. Through UX storytelling, we can grasp a better picture of the user and how they will interact with our products and designs. By starting from the users' perspective, the team can work toward satisfying these specific needs that is described in the personas and scenarios. 

## Key Features in Design
1. Catalog of informational videos about gardening


2. Interactive discussion forums for advice and "marketplace" to exchange and give plants


3. Page to display pictures of users' own plants

**Amy's Scenarios**


***Scenario 1:***


***Why?*** Amy has recently grown her succulent garden after collecting different varieties from friends and family. However, because of its easy propagation, she now has more succulents than she has space for and is saddened by the thought of throwing away perfectly healthy plants. She desperately asks her friends if they would like to take home some succulent plants, but no one offers to take any off of her hands. Determined to find a new home for these succulent plants, she resorts to offering them to strangers on the internet who can care for these plants as much as she does. 


***How?*** Amy takes pictures of her succulent plants on her smartphone and uploads to her personal computer at home. She opens a “marketplace” forum page online and uploads her pictures, listing the succulent description and her location for pick-up, in hopes that someone in her neighborhood can provide a good home for the succulents for free. After listing her succulent post, she browses the marketplace for other listings of plants she may want to exchange her succulents for. Soon after, she receives a comment on her post from a nearby gardener who is interested in taking the succulents off her hands. Amy private-messages the gardener her address and they eventually stop by her house to pick up the succulents.
