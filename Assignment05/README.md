# Assignment 05 - Persona + Scenario
## Purpose of UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows developers and designers to truly understand specific target users and their motivations in order to create a product that caters to their needs and desires. Through UX storytelling, we can grasp a better picture of the user and how they will interact with our products and designs. By starting from the users' perspective, the team can work toward satisfying these specific needs that is described in the personas and scenarios. 

## Key Features in Design
1. Catalog of informational videos about gardening


2. Interactive discussion forums for advice and "marketplace" to exchange and give plants


3. Page to display pictures of users' own plants

**Amy's Scenarios**


***Scenario 1:***


***Why?*** Amy has recently grown her succulent garden after collecting different varieties from friends and family. However, because of its easy propagation, she now has more succulents than she has space for and is saddened by the thought of throwing away perfectly healthy plants. She desperately asks her friends if they would like to take home some succulent plants, but no one offers to take any off of her hands. Determined to find a new home for these succulent plants, she resorts to offering them to strangers on the internet who can care for these plants as much as she does. 


***How?*** Amy takes pictures of her succulent plants on her smartphone and uploads to her personal computer at home. She opens a “marketplace” forum page online and uploads her pictures, listing the succulent description and her location for pick-up, in hopes that someone in her neighborhood can provide a good home for the succulents for free. After listing her succulent post, she browses the marketplace for other listings of plants she may want to exchange her succulents for. Soon after, she receives a comment on her post from a nearby gardener who is interested in taking the succulents off her hands. Amy private-messages the gardener her address and they eventually stop by her house to pick up the succulents. 


***Scenario 2:***


***Why?*** After years of experience tending to her garden, Amy appreciates the intricate beauty of nature as it grows throughout the seasons. When her rare “Queen of the Night” flower that only blooms at night finally opens, she drags her husband and children outside to appreciate it. However, her family does not seem to capture its beauty as much as she hoped. That night, she snapped a couple pictures of the rare flower and showed it to her friends the next day. Her gardening friends beamed at the picture and urged her to share its beauty to a bigger audience online.


***How?*** Using the pictures of the flower she captured on her smartphone, Amy posts them to a gardening picture-sharing platform under her profile @amylittlegarden. To post, she creates an account and is able to share all her photos under one profile, captioning every photo as she desires. Sometimes, she even includes her reflections in the form of a poem inspired by the picture. On this platform, different users are able to browse her garden photos and even follow her if they want to continue seeing her posts. They are also able to comment on her post to ask questions or give compliments. Through this, Amy is able to share the beauty of nature and connect with a bigger community with a similar appreciation for gardening.
