# Gardening Social Site 
#### DH150: UX+UI, by Jessika Wang

## Introduction 
*Gardenfriends.org* seeks to provide informational resources and build an online community within garden-lovers of all expertise levels. The target personas are those in the garden community who wish to expand an individual love for plants online to share and learn with others. Based on user research, a resource with informational videos and an online platform to converse and share pictures with others would add value to the ways the garden community connect with each other.

## Design Statement
My project hopes to support middle-aged women with a community that understands their hobbies and helps them grow as people, especially during a time of isolation. For many people, gardening is a form of therapy that gives them a sense of serenity when spending time with their plants. Through the understanding of these motivations, we can further advance the therapeutic aspects of gardening, while providing a bond over the love of plants. The project also hopes to enable gardeners to share their proudest plant collections and help one another become better gardeners. Though there are resources about gardening found online and opportunities to join planting communities, I want to mesh the two successfully online, after understanding the user and their motivations behind their love for gardening.

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
During this time of isolation, gardeners are finding it more difficult to interact with their community of same-minded individuals. As of now, online gardening platforms focus primarily on resources and provide limited opportunities and services to connect with other gardeners. Through this heuristic evaluation, I evaluated the features and design of gardening resource websites in order to create a unique experience that encourages community and learning for all levels of gardeners. 

[Garden.org](https://garden.org/) is a website that provides both beginner and avid gardners with resources to connect with one another and gather useful gardening tips. There are many articles and useful information available about all different kinds of plants.

## Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
Through usability testing, we aim to improve the website from the users' perspective. UT allows developers to understand and improve their site/app to achieve a certain goal that is user-driven. Through this usability test, I want to test how the aesthetic and the search engine affects the user's ability to research information in different scenarios. Each task will ask the users to utilize the search bar in order to conduct research related to gardening and test the user's ability to navigate the website. Ultimately, we are trying to understand the user and their perspective of the website's functions.

## User Research: Contextual Inquiry
In order to better understand users and their motivations, I conducted a contextual inquiry on my roommate who enjoys gardening and learning about plants. The methods I used were interview and participatory observation. This was conducted in the apartment in a quiet environment. 


The session included the following sections:

**1. Background Questions** I wanted to learn about the user's decision-making reasoning around their major and hobbies. I also wanted to learn more about their initial ideas around hobby-centered communities. I also want to know the user's typical day to support their lifestyle and needs.

**2. Observations** First, I asked the user to search up any topic on their preferred website and walk me through their thought process. I asked questions throughout the task to learn more about their reasoning. I also asked whether they felt a community online forum was reliable. Next, I asked the user to search for gardening related topics and asked more in depth about their experiences of an online gardening community. I also asked what they are looking for when searching topics and their thoughts on sharing their own gardening experiences online.

**3. Follow-up Questions** I asked direct follow-up questions to find other sources of an online gardening reasource and community. I also asked about their ideas for an online garden community.

## UX Storytelling
UX storytelling allows developers and designers to truly understand specific target users and their motivations in order to create a product that caters to their needs and desires. Through UX storytelling, we can grasp a better picture of the user and how they will interact with our products and designs. By starting from the users' perspective, the team can work toward satisfying these specific needs that is described in the personas and scenarios.

**Key Features in Design**

1. Catalog of informational videos about gardening

2. Interactive discussion forums for advice and "marketplace" to exchange and give plants

3. Page to display pictures of users' own plants

## Low-fidelity Prototype 
The purpose of this low fidelity prototype is to test the flow and verify the functionality of the features designed for the target garden community to fulfill their needs for resources and connections.

**Tasks**
1. Searching for informational garden videos

2. Post questions and receive answers on discussion forum

3. Post pictures of your plants and receive feedback

## Evaluation and Revision History 
Through a cognitive walkthrough and impression test, I constantly received suggestions to revise my design in order to finalize my prototype. Through several tests, I was able to learn how users would interact with my website and discover areas to improve upon.

Main findings: 

* Users are able to understand the key features and purpose of the website from the home page

* A short description about the website on the home page will make the functions clearer

* Include a call to action button to "Start your own account"

* The color scheme and design is simple and appealing, perfect for an older target audience

* Create better back-flow throughout the site

* Looks easy to navigate

## Conclusion 
Creating this high-fidelity interactive prototype was overall quite satisfying to see my work and research of the quarter come to fruition. Throughout this process, I learned several lessons:

* **Learn from similar sites' mistakes and discover needs not currently addressed.** Through studying other sites, I was able to see the features already provided online and discover areas that could be improved to better address gardeners' needs. This step helped set me on a path to brainstorm new ideas.

* **User testing never follows the expected path and you must be prepared to improvise.** In every user test I conducted, the process strayed from my script and expectations. The participants always took different routes than expected, exposing some flaws in my design. However, because I embraced this fact and improvised the test as we went, I was able to learn the user's perspective further.

* **The more user perspective collected, the better. To gather the most authentic data possible, avoid leading questions.** I learned the importance of user testing and feedback, which always resulted in better understanding of how to improve my design and what users want. When creating my prototype, I constantly changed my design based on others' feedback, since I often missed certain elements in the prototype. When I allowed the users to provide their perspective with limited direction, I received more authentic and useful information to understand their motivations.

* **Clear and simple designs are superior.** Especially for my targeted audience of middle-aged women, I believe that effective designs are simple and direct. Both the impression test and cognitive walkthrough helped me gain confidence in my simple design choices. When the site includes several features, it is wiser to keep the design straightforward. 

* **Provide several options for users to arrive at the same destination to avoid confusion.** In my prototype, I included different paths to complete the same action for different types of users. I believe that catering to different types of people by creating many paths allows the site to flow smoothly for everyone. 

* **Include as much detail as possible in your prototype in order to accurately predict how users will experience your site.** Creating digital wireframes on Figma showed me the detail necessary for wireframes when creating web designs. Spending the time to include pictures and make the design more aesthetically pleasing serves as a better example to show users and receive more accurate feedback. In general, I would include more details and interactions in the future to create a more thorough interactive high-fidelity prototype.

Overall, the process was smooth and I was able to understand my target user on a deeper level to create a website design with features that address their needs for a garden resource and community to grow with.
