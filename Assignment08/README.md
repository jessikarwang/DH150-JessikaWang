## User research
In order to better understand users and their motivations, I conducted a contextual inquiry on my roommate who enjoys gardening and learning about plants. The methods I used were interview and participatory observation. This was conducted in the apartment in a quiet environment. 


The session included the following sections:

**1. Background Questions** I wanted to learn about the user's decision-making reasoning around their major and hobbies. I also wanted to learn more about their initial ideas around hobby-centered communities. I also want to know the user's typical day to support their lifestyle and needs.

**2. Observations** First, I asked the user to search up any topic on their preferred website and walk me through their thought process. I asked questions throughout the task to learn more about their reasoning. I also asked whether they felt a community online forum was reliable. Next, I asked the user to search for gardening related topics and asked more in depth about their experiences of an online gardening community. I also asked what they are looking for when searching topics and their thoughts on sharing their own gardening experiences online.

**3. Follow-up Questions** I asked direct follow-up questions to find other sources of an online gardening reasource and community. I also asked about their ideas for an online garden community.

## UX storytelling
UX storytelling allows developers and designers to truly understand specific target users and their motivations in order to create a product that caters to their needs and desires. Through UX storytelling, we can grasp a better picture of the user and how they will interact with our products and designs. By starting from the users' perspective, the team can work toward satisfying these specific needs that is described in the personas and scenarios.
