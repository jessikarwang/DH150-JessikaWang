## Assignment 1 Heuristic Evaluation

## Resources for Mom
I chose to base my project off my mom, who is a middle-aged woman. She is someone with many hobbies and have been recently introduced to the many resources found on the internet. I want to find good sites that many middle-aged women can easily navigate without help from their children. I chose a gardening resource website because I can see my mom searching up gardening tips when working on her own garden.
