# DH 150 Assignment 02 - Jessika Wang
# Pilot Usability Test
## Introduction
Garden.org is a website that provides both beginner and avid gardners with resources to connect with one another and gather useful gardening tips. There are many articles and useful information available about all different kinds of plants. 


After the heuristic evaluation, some usability concerns were raised. Without the searchbar, it would be extremely difficult to find information as the tabs are not organized. However, in my previous heuristic evaluation, I also found errors in the search engine. There are few indication of errors when searching for a keyword that is not available. In addition, the search engine provides unclear presentation of the answers unless the user digs through all the articles. Finally, the aesthetic of the website as a whole is cluttered and unpleasant to look at. 


Through usability testing, we aim to improve the website from the users' perspective. UT allows developers to understand and improve their site/app to achieve a certain goal that is user-driven. Through this usability test, I want to test how the aesthetic and the search engine affects the user's ability to research information in different scenarios. Each task will ask the users to utilize the search bar in order to conduct research related to gardening and test the user's ability to navigate the website. Ultimately, we are trying to understand the user and their perspective of the website's functions. 

## Methodology 
The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet room. The moderator and participant will sit side-by-side. The test will be conducted on a laptop computer and the recording will be done on the zoom app to capture both the video (for facial reactions) and screen recording. The screen recording will have the website and the survey for the moderator to read on the screen. 


First, the moderator will read the script to inform the participant of the test. Then the participant will fill out background question about their experience with the website. Next, there will be a pre-test questionnaire for the participant. Next, we will go onto the testing with scenarios to determine the user's ability to navigate the site. Next there are post-test questionnaires and a product satisfaction card. Finally, the participant will fill out their demographics after the recording has stopped.
