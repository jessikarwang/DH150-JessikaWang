# Pilot Usability Test
## Introduction
[Garden.org](https://garden.org/) is a website that provides both beginner and avid gardners with resources to connect with one another and gather useful gardening tips. There are many articles and useful information available about all different kinds of plants. 


After the heuristic evaluation, some usability concerns were raised. Without the searchbar, it would be extremely difficult to find information as the tabs are not organized. However, in my previous heuristic evaluation, I also found errors in the search engine. There are few indication of errors when searching for a keyword that is not available. In addition, the search engine provides unclear presentation of the answers unless the user digs through all the articles. Finally, the aesthetic of the website as a whole is cluttered and unpleasant to look at. 


Through usability testing, we aim to improve the website from the users' perspective. UT allows developers to understand and improve their site/app to achieve a certain goal that is user-driven. Through this usability test, I want to test how the aesthetic and the search engine affects the user's ability to research information in different scenarios. Each task will ask the users to utilize the search bar in order to conduct research related to gardening and test the user's ability to navigate the website. Ultimately, we are trying to understand the user and their perspective of the website's functions. 

## Methodology 
The pilot usability test will be conducted in a quiet room. The moderator and participant will sit side-by-side. The test will be conducted on a laptop computer and the recording will be done on the zoom app to capture both the video (for facial reactions) and screen recording. The screen recording will have the website and the survey for the moderator to read on the screen. 


First, the moderator will read the script to inform the participant of the test. Then the participant will fill out background question about their experience with the website. Next, there will be a pre-test questionnaire for the participant. Next, we will go onto the testing with scenarios to determine the user's ability to navigate the site. Next there are post-test questionnaires and a product satisfaction card. Finally, the participant will fill out their demographics after the recording has stopped.

## Reflection
During the pilot test, I learned how and when to encourage and help the participant when there was problems outside of their control. If the participant was having trouble within their control, I learned to stay silent and wait for them to finish the task. However, when I noticed that we were searching in the wrong database, I helped redirect the participant on the right path. I also learned to refrain from affirming the participant too much that they are answering correctly, which can create bias. 


The logistics and set-up the test worked out smoothly. I was easily able to use Zoom for both the screen recording and facial recording. I was able to read the moderator script to the participant and she could still answer the survey questions as we sat side-by-side. My participant verbally expressed her thoughts throughout the test, which is helpful to understand the user. One thing that was difficult to maneuver was when the articles that needed to appear were not visible since we were searching in the wrong database, which I'm still not sure how that happened. This caused the participant to have difficulty finding the answers to complete Task 2. To improve the UT in the future, I would create more tasks that explore different functions of the website and are not as straightforward. In the future I also will have more experience to know when to help the participant and when to simply observe.
